USB Rubber ducky script to download a file from the internet quickly<br>
<br>
This payload is still in early stages and not fully tested.
<br><br>
You will need to modify the string in the script to point to the file you want to download.
<br><br>
If the default browser is unselected, then you will have to press the launch button again as the delays are not in place to cover this.
<br><br>
After launching it will download the file. For Chrome is will clear the browsing history for the download as well as load the Downloads section for quick deletion by the attacker.
<br><br>
As with any ducky scripts, one must have physical access to the unlocked device. This script is simply to make loading the browser and downloading the file quicker than typing everything in.
